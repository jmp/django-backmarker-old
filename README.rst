Backmarker
==========

Backmarker is my hobby project for a Formula 1 results website and API.
The aim is to provide a simple user interface for managing Formula 1
results, and a read-only API for querying the results.

Planned features:

* PostgreSQL database for storing the data
* A read-only REST API for querying the results
* Dockerfile for easy deployment

It is still work in progress.
